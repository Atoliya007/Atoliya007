# Hi, I'm Vinod atoliyaüëã

I'm a software developer in training with 4 months of hands-on experience. I'm passionate about building web applications and learning new technologies.
Currently, I'm focusing on backend development with Python, Django, and FastAPI, while also exploring frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and React. 
I have a solid understanding of SQL databases and enjoy working on full-stack projects.
